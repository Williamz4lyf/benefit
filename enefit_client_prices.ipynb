    "# Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in this competition is to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels. The dataset includes weather data, the relevant energy prices, and records of the installed photovoltaic capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a forecasting competition using the time series API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of prosumers is rapidly increasing, and solving the problems of energy imbalance and their rising costs is vital. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources. If this problem were effectively solved, it would significantly reduce the imbalance costs, improve the reliability of the grid, and make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable. Moreover, it could potentially incentivize more consumers to become prosumers, knowing that their energy behavior can be adequately managed, thus promoting renewable energy production and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About us**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enefit is one of the biggest energy companies in Baltic region. As experts in the field of energy, we help customers plan their green journey in a personal and flexible manner as well as implement it by using environmentally friendly energy solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, Enefit is attempting to solve the imbalance problem by developing internal predictive models and relying on third-party forecasts. However, these methods have proven to be insufficient due to their low accuracy in forecasting the energy behavior of prosumers. The shortcomings of these current methods lie in their inability to accurately account for the wide range of variables that influence prosumer behavior, leading to high imbalance costs. By opening up the challenge to the world's best data scientists through the Kaggle platform, Enefit aims to leverage a broader pool of expertise and novel approaches to improve the accuracy of these predictions and consequently reduce the imbalance and associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted return and the observed target. The formula is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑀𝐴𝐸=1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛|𝑦𝑖−𝑥𝑖|\n",
    "MAE = 1n∑i=1n|yi-xi|\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* 𝑛 is the total number of data points.\n",
    "* 𝑦𝑖 is the predicted value for data point i.\n",
    "* 𝑥𝑖 is the observed value for data point i.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit to this competition using the provided python time-series API, which ensures that models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow the template in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohier/enefit-basic-submission-demo).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline**\n",

    "* January 31, 2024 - Final Submission Deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prediction Timeline:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting after the final submission deadline there will be periodic updates to the leaderboard to reflect future data updates that will be evaluated against selected submissions. We anticipate 1-3 interim updates before the final evaluation.\n",

    "Analyzing the residual component resulting from a seasonal decomposition helps to understand the unexplained variation in the time series after accounting for the trend, seasonality, and other identified components. It is crucial to assess the goodness-of-fit of the decomposition model and to detect any remaining patterns or information that the model didn't capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the residual plot appears to be approximately normal and the autocorrelation plot shows a flat line with no significant spikes. This indicates that residuals are centered and have consistent variability. \n",

    "The flat autocorrelation also indicates the absence of significant autocorrelation at different lags, which suggests that the residuals are not correlated at different time lags, indicating randomness or lack of systematic patterns.\n",

    "The normal distribution and absence of significant autocorrelation in residuals suggest that the seasonal decomposition model adequately captures the underlying trend, seasonality, and other components present in the time series data for electricty prices. This implies goodness of fit and model adequacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of autocorrelation further implies that any remaining variation in the data captured by the residuals is random noise or unexplained variability, rather than systematic patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore use the decomposition model to forecast future observation as the model adequately captures the data's variability.\n",
