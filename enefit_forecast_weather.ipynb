    "# Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in this competition is to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels. The dataset includes weather data, the relevant energy prices, and records of the installed photovoltaic capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a forecasting competition using the time series API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of prosumers is rapidly increasing, and solving the problems of energy imbalance and their rising costs is vital. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources. If this problem were effectively solved, it would significantly reduce the imbalance costs, improve the reliability of the grid, and make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable. Moreover, it could potentially incentivize more consumers to become prosumers, knowing that their energy behavior can be adequately managed, thus promoting renewable energy production and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About us**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enefit is one of the biggest energy companies in Baltic region. As experts in the field of energy, we help customers plan their green journey in a personal and flexible manner as well as implement it by using environmentally friendly energy solutions.\n",
    "At present, Enefit is attempting to solve the imbalance problem by developing internal predictive models and relying on third-party forecasts. However, these methods have proven to be insufficient due to their low accuracy in forecasting the energy behavior of prosumers. The shortcomings of these current methods lie in their inability to accurately account for the wide range of variables that influence prosumer behavior, leading to high imbalance costs. By opening up the challenge to the world's best data scientists through the Kaggle platform, Enefit aims to leverage a broader pool of expertise and novel approaches to improve the accuracy of these predictions and consequently reduce the imbalance and associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted return and the observed target. The formula is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑀𝐴𝐸=1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛|𝑦𝑖−𝑥𝑖|\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* 𝑛 is the total number of data points.\n",
    "* 𝑦𝑖 is the predicted value for data point i.\n",
    "* 𝑥𝑖 is the observed value for data point i.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit to this competition using the provided python time-series API, which ensures that models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow the template in this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohier/enefit-basic-submission-demo).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a future data prediction competition with an active training phase and a second period where selected submissions will be evaluated against future ground truth data.\n",

    "* November 1, 2023 - Start Date.\n",
    "* January 24, 2024 - Entry Deadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to compete.\n",
    "* January 24, 2024 - Team Merger Deadline. This is the last day participants may join or merge teams.\n",
    "* January 31, 2024 - Final Submission Deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prediction Timeline:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting after the final submission deadline there will be periodic updates to the leaderboard to reflect future data updates that will be evaluated against selected submissions. We anticipate 1-3 interim updates before the final evaluation.\n",

    "Explaining Variations in Solar Radiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "About 37% of the variation in solar radiation is explained by the other features in the dataset using a linear regression model. This may imply that the relationship between the features are not linear, however, the rank correlation heatmap did not provide values that were significantly different from the pearson correlation heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpreting the Durbin-Watson Statistic*\n",
    "\n",
    "The low Durbin-Watson statistics indicate positive autocorrelation, implying that there is a systematic relationship between teh residuals (errors) of the model at different points/ observations in the dataset. Since our dataset is a time series, this implies that adjacent or nearby residuals tend to have similar values or patterns. We'll see this in visually in the plots below. In our case, positive autocorrelation suggests that if solar radiation is higher (or lower) than predicted on one day, it is more likely to be higher (or lower) than predicted on the next day as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This positive serial correlation in residuals violates the assumption of independence and can affect the reliability of statistical tests and the efficiency of coefficient estimates in regression analysis. It indicates that the model does not account for some systematic pattern or structure present in the data, leading to inefficiencies in the estimation process. We will test for seasonality in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpreting the Jarque-Bera Statistic*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linear Regression, residuals should ideally be normally distributed for valid inference. A low Jarque-Bera test statistic (and a high p-value) suggests that residuals are normally distributed, indicating that the assumption of normality might be valid. Conversely, a high test statistic (and a low p-value) suggests departure from normality in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have a significantly high Jarque-Bera statistic, implying a significant deviation from normality in the residuals. We will see this visually in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpreting the Skewness & Kurtosis Values*\n",
    "\n",
    "The skewness values in both models indicate moderate positive skewness in the distribution of the residuals, i.e. tail extending to the right toward higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kurtosis values in both models indicate higher-than-normal kurtosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the direct solar radiation model, with a kurtosis value of 4, indicates a mesokurtic distribution. Mesokurtic distributions have a kurtosis value that is the same as that of a normal distribution. A kurtosis of 4 suggests a distribution that is similar in tailedness and peakedness to a normal distribution, without significant tails or an extremely peaked shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combined with its skewness value of 0.9, these values indicate a distribution that is somewhat positively skewed (more values on the left side, fewer extreme values on the right) and has a kurtosis close to that of a normal distribution. Moderate skewness and kurtosis suggest that the distribution might deviate slightly from perfect symmetry and the exact shape of a normal distribution, but it does not exhibit extreme departures in tailedness or peakedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of regression analysis, these mild departures from perfect normality might have minimal impact on the reliability of statistical inferences or the performance of the regression model. Usually, these levels of skewness and kurtosis are within an acceptable range and might not significantly affect the model assumptions or interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the surface solar radiation model, with a kurtosis value of 5.7, indicates a leptokurtic distribution. Leptokurtic distributions have heavier tails and a higher peak (more concentration of values around the mean) compared to a normal distribution (which has a kurtosis of 3). A value of 5.7 suggests that the distribution or residuals have a higher number of outliers or extreme values in the tails than what is typical in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combined with its skewness value of 1.2, these values suggest that the distribution of the residuals may deviate from a normal distribution. A positively skewed distribution with higher kurtosis indicates non-normality, potentially indicating the presence of outliers, heavier tails, or a more peaked distribution than the normal curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with regression analysis, such departures from normality might impact the reliability of statistical inferences or the performance of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion*\n",
    "\n",
    "On the question of skewness, kurtosis, Durbin-Watson and Jarque-Bera, the direct solar radiation model is a better fit model. "
